# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
1. Make sure all your files are committed to your repository
2. Ensure your main HTML file is named `index.html` (✅ Already correct)
3. Verify you have a `.nojekyll` file (✅ Already present)

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Update Your URL
Once your site is deployed, you'll get a URL like:
`https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

**Important**: Update line 15 in your `index.html`:
```html
<meta property="og:url" content="https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name">
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
